<a href="https://blog.miniorange.com/what-is-ciam-customer-identity-and-access-management/" target="_blank">miniOrange CIAM solution</a> for WordPress ensures a **secure, seamless customer experience** at extreme scale & performance whether it is web (or) mobile. Companies that use a Customer Identity solution can quickly onboard prospective customers by simplifying registration and providing <a href="https://www.miniorange.com/products/single-sign-on-sso" target="_blank">Single Sign-On (SSO)</a>. In addition to acquiring customers faster, this solution helps organizations deliver frictionless user experiences and protect customer data throughout the customer lifecycle.

While IAM focuses on an inside solution (for employees), CIAM is a solution that focuses on the outside world (for external customers). Also, in a CIAM, users manage their own accounts and profiles.

* **Social Login:**
Social Login through CIAM for WordPress allows social login, social share & commenting using widely used apps like **Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, Apple, Discord, Twitch, Line, Wechat, and 40 other apps** available. Instead of requiring your visitors to waste time filling out the typical registration form, it allows them to register/login to your website using their social media profiles.

* **<a href="https://www.miniorange.com/products/single-sign-on-sso" target="_blank">Single Sign-On</a>:**
Single Sign-On simplifies the user’s onboarding process allowing users to register by signing up or using social registration. It allows users to log in to **multiple applications** by using just **one set of credentials.**

* **<a href="https://www.miniorange.com/products/multi-factor-authentication-mfa" target="_blank">Multi-Factor Authentication:</a>**
You can configure multiple WordPress 2FA/MFA methods like **google authenticator, OTP over Email, OTP over SMS**, etc., and choose any one method from a list of configured methods to use as 2FA/MFA for your WordPress website. Multi-factor authentication is helpful for cases such as when you do not have your phone and cannot access your TOTP app for login. You can then use other MFA methods like OTP over Email to login.

* **<a href="https://www.miniorange.com/products/identity-broker-service" target="_blank">Identity Brokering</a>:**

Passwordless Login is a modern way of logging into your WordPress site **without the use of a password**. The plugin allows you to easily set up Passwordless Login for your site. Users would now be able to log in using their Username and OTP. If you wish to allow our users to fall back to Username and Password then the plugin also allows that.

CIAM for WordPress includes Adaptive Authentication which is an advanced form of <a href="https://blog.miniorange.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication-mfa/" target="_blank">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> is a process of selecting the right authentication factors depending on a user’s risk profile like **user's behavior, device IP, time, geo-location**, etc. to adapt the type of authorization factors.

* **Automated User Management:**

= Personalization to Improve the Customer Experience =

<a href="https://miniorange.com” target="_blank">miniOrange’s</a> Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) for WordPress Solution can help companies build customer trust while minimizing operating costs and maximizing revenue and retention. By building trust and loyalty with customers, CIAM can help you acquire more customers, build more customer interactions, and influence cross-sells.
Customer Identity Management System gathers data about customers as they move through the customer journey. This data is used to build a profile of customer preferences on WordPress, which can then be used to customize product offerings and communications. New information, such as a change of address, is automatically shared with apps that use the customer profile.
Although CIAM and IAM solutions share the same building blocks, the traditional IAM solutions cannot be extended to replace/act in place of a CIAM solution. The unique requirement of a client-facing application needs a flexible and scalable Identity and Access Management solution that requires a dedicated solution built on top of IAM features.
By exploiting identification data to gain and retain consumers, CIAM generates revenue growth. CIAM systems are intended to supply, authenticate, authorize, collect, and store consumer information from a variety of sources.
